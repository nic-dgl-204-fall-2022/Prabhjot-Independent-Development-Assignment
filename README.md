# Prabhjot-Independent-Development-Assignment

For my independent development project, I will be creating the Unit Converter Project.

# Reflection

## Week 4

This week’s plan is to complete the first stage of the Unit Converter Project from JetBrains, i.e. Standard Output. I need to give more time studying the Standard Output & other stages. I also, have to review whatever I have learnt about Kotlin from this course because it will be helping me in the later stages of this project. This week, exploring the Standard Output can be called a challenge, but it is fun to me. 

Challenge because to reach to the final stage of the project (i.e. Work on Project) I had to pass several sections of this stage which contained the theoretical part to read and questions including (MCQ + coding) 5+ problems in every practice part of sections to solve. So, this whole process to reach the final section of the stage which was the “Work on Project” was challenging for me. The fun part was the last section because it is an easy one compared to the MCQs I solved in the previous sections where I had to simply print the given statement.


**My experience this week-** 

The first stage of the project was easy and I barely took 30-35 minutes to complete this stage’s theoretical part. Some of the theory part I skipped which was very basic (in initial sections) and for some theory part, I had to pause & revise the previous notes (in final sections like literals & standard output). Though, solving the MCQ + coding problems in every practice part of sections took time which gave me great value for that time because, from those, I learnt a lot and also it gave me the opportunity to revise whatever I have learnt from this course till yet. 

**My Progress this week-**

By the end of this week-4, I am done with stage 1 and also read the first two theory part of sections of stage 2. I [committed the code](https://github.com/nic-dgl-204-fall-2022/Prabhjot-Independent-Development-Assignment/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/stage1.kt) of stage 1 (Section- Work on project, Standard Output) in which I had to print the unit conversions lines for different physical quantities (like 145 centimetres is 1.45 meters). 

**Next week’s Plan-**

After getting a glance at the first stage and my week's plan I got an understanding that what should I have to practice more. I found loops, ranges, enum classes and lists to be challenging or the topics in which I will be invested for next weeks.
I wish to do more stages by the end of the 5th week but 2nd stage has too many sections still I try my best to complete stage 2 by the end of week 5, and also will try to reach the final section of stage 3.

## Week 5
I completed the stage 2 code and also did some of the sections of stage 3 this week. 

# Future Options-

After completing this project I would love to get into some of the projects which are related to data structures as data structures are one most important concepts in programming so making a project using data structures with Kotlin will boost my skills. 
Some of the projects I selected are as below- 

-	[Connect Four](https://hyperskill.org/projects/202?track=18) – This project includes some of the data structures as written in its description, so it will definitely going to help.
-	[Minesweeper](https://hyperskill.org/projects/8?track=18)- This project will help me to understand Kotlin more deeply with object-oriented programming as this includes objects and classes in its first stage to learn.
