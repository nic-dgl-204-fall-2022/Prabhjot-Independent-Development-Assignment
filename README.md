# Prabhjot-Independent-Development-Assignment

For my independent development project, I will be creating the Unit Converter Project.

## Reflection

**Week 4**

This weekâ€™s plan is to complete the first stage of the Unit Converter Project from JetBrains, i.e. Standard Output. I need to give more time studying the Standard Output & other stages. I also, have to review whatever I have learnt about Kotlin from this course because it will be helping me in the later stages of this project. This week, exploring the Standard Output can be called a challenge, but it is fun to me. However, I may face a few challenges in further stages but my focus would be to value the learning process and to get the most out of it.
